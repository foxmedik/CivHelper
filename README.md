A small guide written in python meant as a Always-On-Top guide for Civilization V for all 42 civilization in-game. 

You can run the Civvhelper.py in Python 3.10 or above, or use the included .exe in the Dist folder. 

All credit to written guide work is to Zigzagzigal on Steam for an excellent concise guide for every civ. I get annoyed having to Shift-Tab to read and scroll the guide though, and wanted something small and lightweight that could be placed and resized anywhere.
